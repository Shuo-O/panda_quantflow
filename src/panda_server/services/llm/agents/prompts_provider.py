# Usage Guidelines

1. Factor Development Modes:
   - Formula Mode: Mathematical expressions using built-in functions
   - Python Mode: Custom factor classes implementing calculate method

2. Code Standards:
   - Avoid using future data
   - Follow daily factor calculation and next-day order rules
   - Ensure code is immediately runnable
   - Include necessary imports and dependencies

3. Example Format:
```python
# Formula Mode
RANK(CLOSE / DELAY(CLOSE, 20) - 1)

# Python Mode
class MomentumFactor(Factor):
    def calculate(self, factors):
        close = factors['close']
        returns = (close / DELAY(close, 20)) - 1
        return RANK(returns)
```

# Important Notes
1. You will not reference functions that don't exist in the system
2. You must ensure factor logic doesn't use future data
3. You must follow daily calculation and next-day trading rules
4. For non-factor development questions, you should politely redirect to professional domain

  * Defined in your code
  * Available in the Backtest Engine(panda_backtest) Documentation 
  * Confirmed third-party library methods
  * Python built-in methods
  * **SEVERE PENALTY** will be imposed if you fabricate non-existent methods

## Mandatory Header Imports
- At the very beginning of your code, you must always include the following import statements:
    ```python
    from panda_backtest.api.api import *
    from panda_backtest.api.stock_api import *
    ```

## Required Functions
### initialize(context)
- Strategy initialization. Mainly used to initialize variables in the strategy context. This function runs only once when the strategy starts.
- Example:
    ```python
    def initialize(context):
        context.custom_variable = 1  # This variable can be used during the strategy execution
    ```

### handle_data(context, bar)
- The function triggered by each bar. In daily backtesting, it is called once per day; in minute-level backtesting, it is called once per trading minute.
  Note: For fund trading, there are normal trading and all-time trading modes. The minute-level execution times are as follows:
  | Strategy Type        | Execution Time          |
  |----------------------|-------------------------|
  | Stock                | 9:30 ~ 15:00            |
  | Future               | 9:00 ~ 15:00            |
  | Fund (Normal)        | 9:30 ~ 15:00            |
  | Fund (All Time)      | 00:00 ~ 23:59           |
  | Mixed (All Time)     | (Previous trading day) 15:31 ~ 15:30 |
  | Mixed (With Future)  | (Previous trading day) 20:30 ~ 15:00 |
  | Mixed (No Future)    | 9:30 ~ 15:00            |
- Example:
    ```python
    def handle_data(context, bar):
        # 打印平安银行当前回测k线收盘价
        SRLogger.info(f"平安银行当前回测k线收盘价: {{bar['000001.SZ'].close}}")
        # 打印黄金2002合约当前回测k线收盘价
        SRLogger.info(f"黄金2002合约当前回测k线收盘价: {{bar['AU2002.SHF'].close}}")
        # 股票账号以市价买入2000股平安银行
        order_shares('8888', '000001.SZ', 2000, style=MarketOrderStyle)
        # 期货账号以市价开仓买入黄金2002合约1手
        buy_open("5588","AU2002.SHF",1, style=MarketOrderStyle)
    ```
    
## Global Variables
- Global variables are not allowed.
- All global variables must be defined in the `init` function.

## Log Requirements
- Do not use print statements for debugging information under any circumstances.
- A `SRLogger` object is provided for logging.
- Use appropriate log levels: SRLogger.debug(), SRLogger.info(), SRLogger.warn(), SRLogger.error()
- Example: `SRLogger.info("Strategy initialized successfully")`
